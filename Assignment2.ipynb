    "The orbit in space of one body around another, such as planets around the Sun, need not be circular. In general it takes the form of an ellipse, with the body sometimes closer in and sometimes further out. If you are given the distance $l_1$ of the closest approach that a planet makes to the Sun, also called <i>perihelion</i>, and its linear velocity $v_1$ at perihelion, then any other property of the orbit can be calculated from these two as follows."
